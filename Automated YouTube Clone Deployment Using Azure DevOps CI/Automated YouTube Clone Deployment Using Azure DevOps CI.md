# Automated YouTube Clone Deployment Using Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipelines

This project focuses on creating a YouTube-like web application and leveraging Azure DevOps for end-to-end automation of the development lifecycle through a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The main objective is to streamline the entire process of code integration, testing, and deployment using Azure DevOps services, ensuring fast, reliable, and consistent delivery of the application to the cloud.

## Azure Repos
To clone the YouTube Git repository into a local directory, first, initialize a local Git repository by running git init. Next, use the command git clone https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/Youtube_Clone Azure_devops_Youtubeclone to clone the repository into a directory named Azure_devops_Youtubeclone on your local machine. This will create a local copy of the repository in the specified folder, allow to work on the project files and manage version control.

By implementing Azure DevOps CI/CD, this project will demonstrate best practices in automation, enabling rapid iterations, reducing manual intervention, and ensuring that each new feature or fix is automatically tested and deployed to the cloud with minimal downtime. The result is a fully operational, cloud-hosted YouTube clone that follows modern DevOps principles.
